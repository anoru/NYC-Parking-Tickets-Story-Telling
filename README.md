#### Summary

If you own a car in a major city, chances are you've gotten a parking ticket. The above visualization using **NYC open data** to give you an idea about how data can be used to detect factors and help on preventing from getting ticketed or towed

#### Design

I tried to focus the audience's attention on the insight I want them to act on by maintaining a large data-ink ratio/data Integrity and removing unnecessary items from visuals. I also used color but only when necessary. (The pallets sensitive to those with colorblindness)

#### Feedback

- Use caption boxes instead of dots (many of not familiar with Tableau think the the visualization has one page)
- Add descriptions and summaries to explain the visualizations
- Write the full names of counties x axis in the second page instead of abbreviation
- Explain How to use the map and correct some text errors or reformat it
